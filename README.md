Got this idea back to 2017, finally decide to write it down. In the near future, maybe a few hundred years past from now. 

I believe human can travel faster than lights, and build space station/ship anywhere.

And when people travel fast enough, they can catch history light that is emitted from earth (e.g. if they wanna catch the lights emitted from 1600, when it comes to year 2400, they will travel/jump to a place that is 800 light years from earth + the time it takes for the space ship to get there). So, people should be able to see the history of earth. They might see the face of these acient emperors and other famous people. I am really curious about how does Qin Shi Huang, the guy who united China looks like.


Well, I should find a place and wave my hands to the sky tomorrow..... So, if people in the later years can ever see this, then they could see me waving hands to the sky. Haha, good idea. I will do it and put the time + place where I wave my hands, to people in the future can get this, :D
